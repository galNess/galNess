- [CityLearn MAD CATS](https://github.com/RoyElkabetz/CityLearn-MAD-CATS): Our implementation of a solution for the NeurIPS 2022 CityLearn challenge, featuring novel ideas for multi-agent, distributed control tree search. These techniques allowed us to effectively explore and exploit information from the relatively far future.
